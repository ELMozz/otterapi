= Rate Limit =

The Otter API uses a credit allocation system to ensure fair 
distribution of capacity. Each IP is allocated 10,000 credits 
per hour.  You can check the status of your credits with the 
following call:

{{{
http://otter.topsy.com/credit.json
}}}

In addition, each request contains rate limit information in the HTTP response headers.

|| *HTTP Header*            || *Description ||
|| `X-RateLimit-Limit`      || Total credits that can be allocated. ||
|| `X-RateLimit-Remaining`  || Total credits available. ||
|| `X-RateLimit-Reset`      || Timestamp (unix epoch) for when the credits will be reset. ||

== Cost of API calls ==

Unless otherwise noted, an API call deducts 1 credit from your allocation.  Search based API calls (/search, /searchcount, /authorsearch, /profilesearch) have a significantly higher computational cost on our backend, and deduct 10 credits per call.

=== Example HTTP Response Headers ===

{{{
X-RateLimit-Limit: 10000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 2498
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1250791200
}}}

= Paging Limits =

All calls that take [ResListParameters list parameters] limit `perpage` to 100 and `page` to 15. This gives you access to top 1500 items on any list.

= Attribution =

If you use Otter API in your application or service, we'd appreciate if you tell your users about the API.  A message like: 

    "!YourAppName uses the [http://otter.topsy.com/ Otter API from Topsy Labs]."

= Client Identification =

We request that you identify your application or service via the `User-Agent` HTTP header. This value should be the url to your service or application. This is not mandatory, but when under heavy load, we will give preference to clients that identify themselves. It is also possible to identify via `X-Topsy-UA` HTTP header, if modifying the `User-Agent` header is not possible.

= Higher grade access = 

We plan to support higher grade of access in the future.  If you need this, please [Contact contact us].
