= Error Handing =

A successful Otter call returns with the HTTP code 200.  Everything else is an error or special condition and all well-written apps must handle these gracefully. 

 * *400 Parameter check failed.* This error indicates that a required parameter is missing or a parameter has a value that is out of bounds.

 * *403 Forbidden*. You don't have access to this action. 

 * *404 Action not supported.* This indicates that a [Resources resource] that does not exist has been requested.

 * *503 Temporarily unavailable.* Whenever the API is unavailable for scheduled or unscheduled downtime, we'll try our best to return a 503 error code.
