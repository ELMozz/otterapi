== Error Handing: ==

The following HTTP error codes are used to indicate an error condition and any app that uses the API should handle these.

 * *503 Temporarily unavailable.* Whenever the API is unavailable for scheduled or unscheduled downtime, we'll try our best to return a 503 error code.

 * *400 Parameter check failed.* This error indicates that a required parameter is missing or a parameter has a value that is out of bounds.

 * *404 Action not supported.
